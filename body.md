# sculpting a broad-shouldered, proportionate, and athletic looking physique
1. Broad, rounded shoulders that are well balanced in all three heads in order create the elusive “V-taper” shape
2. A chiseled chest that is full yet well developed within the upper, middle, and lower regions
3. A muscular back with adequate thickness AND width to add to the “V-taper” shape
4. Strong yet not overdeveloped upper traps to create a powerful looking upper body
5. Thick and well defined arms with proportionate balance between the biceps and triceps
6. Visible, defined abdominals and obliques to compliment the upper body muscles
7. Legs that are proportionate to the upper body yet not bulky in order to complete the “athletic” look
